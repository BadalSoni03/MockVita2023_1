Problem Description
John is working in high security organization, where he needs to deal with lot of confidential documents. He must encrypt the important number in documents. Please help John to write a program where the system should identify the integer number and encrypt number based on John’s actions.

John’s actions are as follows

Actions	Denoted by	Remarks
Right arrow	R	Move to next character
Left arrow	T	Move to previous character
Up arrow	L	Increment the integer by one
Down arrow	D	Decrement the integer by one
Swap	Sn	Swap the current position with number in the nth position
These actions are governed by the rules mentioned below.

Rules

Initial position is at the first character of the string comprised of numbers.
When incrementing the value of a number at a current location, if the number is 9 then it remains 9 else it increases by 1.
When decrementing the value of a number at a current location, if the number is 0 then it remains O else it decreases by 1.
Once all the actions from the action string are consumed, if any part of the input string remained unprocessed then leave those characters of the input string as they are.
Constraints
0 <n<= I where I is length of the input string.

Input
First line contains a string comprising of numbers. This is referred to as input string in the rest of the document.
Second line contains the actions denoted by values mentioned in the table above. This is referred to as action string in the rest of the document.

Output
Single string comprising of numbers.

Time Limit (secs)
1

Examples

Input
123456
RLTDRRTRS2S1

Output
244156

Explanation

Initial string: 123456

Action: RLTDRRTRS2S1

R: 1[2]3456
L: [1]23456
T: [2]23456
D: [1]23456
R: 1[2]3456
R: 12[3]456
T:12[4]456
R: 124[4]56
S2: 144[2]56
S1: 244[1]56

output string.
